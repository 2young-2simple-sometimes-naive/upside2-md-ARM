Self Avoid Random Walk Simulation

In this simulation, most of the non-bonding interactions 
were added except for the steric repulsion between backbone 
atoms. Since all the expensive forces are excluded, the 
simulation will be much faster than a normal simulation.

TODO:
add the script to calculate the P_of_r
