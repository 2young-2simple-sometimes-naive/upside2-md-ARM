This example shows:
1. how to perform a replica exchange simulation
2. how to restart the simulation from the last state of the previous simulation

Similar to the first example, you can use python script run.py to try this example:

source ../../source.sh
python run.py


More detailed analysis will be shown in the third example.

TODO:
finish the script "generate_restart_config.py" to modify the .up file to restart the simulation
